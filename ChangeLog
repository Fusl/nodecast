2013.11.22, Version 0.1.1 (Beta)

- transcoder.js
* Combined source and jingle streams into one function and one config (sources) (Still need to change a few things here, don't use jingles in production!)
* Implemented passthrough streams for much better performance
* Other performance increasements and code cleanups (finally... thank god) :-)

- dispatcher.js
* Important bugfix: The metainterval has been calculated wrong: If a chunk was larger than the metainterval bytes set on the transcoder, the chunk hasn't been split into metainterval bytes to fit in there. Instead it has been written to the client without any slicings or splittings done. This caused messed up streams and the listeners had to reconnect to the stream.
* Code cleanups also done here

- functions.js
* Added the functions needed by passthrough streams here

- *
: TODO: Working on a json-config system to prevent overwrites done by updating the programs

2013.11.21, Version 0.0.5 (Beta)

- transcoder.js
* Bugfix~: Default-Codec "libfaac" is an alias to aac but not on all systems out there
* Bugfix~: Default-Retrywait should be really low to prevent underflow in the buffer

- dispatcher.js
* Bugfix: clients now don't get too many listeners caused by a typo in the overflow-check
* Bugfix: process does not crash anymore by serving /listen.pls when mounts aren't setup completely
* Moved init-starts from anywhere between function definitions to the bottom

- functions.js
* Initial commit (moved often called functions from all js files into there)

2013.11.13, Version 0.0.3 (Alpha)

- transcoder.js
* Added: configuration variable, when to play the jingle at the specified event (if event is emitted AND atHours has the current hour in the list, then play the jingle)
* Removed: status output function completely from code (status output != log output)
* Bugfix: if the mountpoint hasn't been setup completely and a jingle-event occured, this made the process crash and is fixed now
* Bugfix: Weird handling of priority for a source stream not given is fixed now (checking all source and jingle streams for an undefined priority and setting priority to 0)
* Bugfix: Server did not use global configuration variables, fixed now
* Bugfix: Right handling of desynced and unsyncdiscard decision is fixed now

* Bugfix: makemeta will now be called by an interval and only requests and converts the metaurl data to meta information, when icy-metaint is set correct
