{"name":"Nodecast","tagline":"nodecast is a high performance shoutcast-/icecast-like server, playlist, stream transcoder and dispatcher","body":"nodecast\r\n===\r\n\r\nnodecast is a high performance live streaming transcoder and stream \"muxer\"\r\n\r\n### How to install?\r\nJust clone this repositore in a directory of your choice.\r\n\r\n### How to configure?\r\n```nano configs/*.json``` and edit to your needs. The syntax for these configuration files is [JSON](http://json.org/ \"JSON website\"). If you don't know how to write JSON files, [open a new issue ticket](https://github.com/Fusl/nodecast/issues), completely describe what you need and we will try to build your configuration which fits your needs.\r\n\r\n### Why multiple files?\r\nnodecast is a streaming system split into multiple scripts to be able to install each script on a different server (distribute load over multiple host systems). Installing the scripts on different servers also prevents your streaming network from being flooded directly at the transcoder or dj server.\r\n\r\n### How to run?\r\nAfter configuring all the scripts (.json files) you can fire up the scripts by running ```./scriptname.js < scriptname.json``` (e.g. ```./transcoder.js < transcoder.json```).\r\n\r\n### Bugs?\r\nIf we find bugs, we are gonna fix them. But we don't always find bugs and therefor need your help: If you find any type of bug (memory leak, high cpu usage, weird behaviour when doing something special, etc.), please open a new issue ticket.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
